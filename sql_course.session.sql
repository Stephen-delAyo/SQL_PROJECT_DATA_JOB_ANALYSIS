/*
CASE EXPRESSION 
A CASE expression is a way to perform conditional logic in SQL queries.
It allows you to return different values based on certain conditions.
The CASE expression can be used in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and other clauses.
The syntax for a CASE expression is as follows:
SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN column name = 'value1' THEN 'Description for value1'
        WHEN column name = 'value2' THEN 'Description for value2'
        ELSE 'other'
    END AS column_description    
FROM
    table_name;
*/
/*
CASE - begins the expression
WHEN - specifies the condition(s) to check
THEN - specifies the value to return if the condition is true
ELSE - specifies the value to return if none of the conditions are true
END - ends the CASE expression

/* 
SUBQUERIES and CTEs
- A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query.
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- CTEs are similar to subqueries but can be more readable and reusable.
- Subqueries can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses.
- CTEs can be used to break down complex queries into simpler parts, making them easier to understand and maintain.
- Subqueries can be used to filter results, perform calculations, or retrieve additional data.
- Note that subqueries can be correlated or non-correlated. A correlated subquery depends on the outer query, while a non-correlated subquery does not.
- Also note that SUBQUERIES are for simpler queries while CTEs are for more complex queries.
- Subqueries can be used in SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses, while CTEs are defined using the WITH clause.
- CTEs can be recursive, allowing you to perform operations on hierarchical data.
- CTEs are defined using the WITH clause and can be used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
- subqueries can be used in various clauses such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING.
- The syntax for a subquery is as follows:        
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT column_name FROM another_table WHERE condition);

/* UNION OPERATOR
The UNION operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements.
- The UNION operator removes duplicate rows from the result set.
- The UNION ALL operator includes all rows, including duplicates.
- The number of columns and their data types must match in all SELECT statements. 
- That is, Each SELECT statement must have the same number of columns, and the corresponding columns must have compatible data types.
- The column names in the result set are taken from the first SELECT statement.
- The UNION operator can be used to combine results from different tables or queries.
EXAMPLE of the UNION syntax is:
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table2;

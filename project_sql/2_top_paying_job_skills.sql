/*
Hereâ€™s a highlighted list of the **top 10 skills data engineers should have in 2025**:

### 1. **Python**

* Widely used for data manipulation, ETL pipelines, and data analysis.

### 2. **Apache Spark**

* Essential for large-scale data processing (batch and real-time).

### 3. **SQL and NoSQL Databases**

* SQL remains critical for relational databases, while NoSQL is important for unstructured and semi-structured data.

### 4. **Data Warehousing (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery)**

* Key tools for centralized data storage and analytics in cloud-based environments.

### 5. **ETL/ELT Processes**

* Expertise in designing and maintaining data pipelines for efficient data movement and transformation.

### 6. **Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)**

* Proficiency in cloud platforms for scalable data storage and processing.

### 7. **Containerization and Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)**

* Ensures scalability and consistency in deploying data applications and workflows.

### 8. **Data Modeling and Schema Design**

* Skills in creating efficient data structures for optimized data storage and retrieval.

### 9. **Data Governance and Security**

* Knowledge of data privacy, security, and compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR).

### 10. **Machine Learning and AI Integration**

* Ability to integrate machine learning models into data pipelines and support data scientists.

### Honorable Mentions:

* **Apache Kafka** (Real-time data streaming)
* **DevOps** practices (Automated deployment and scaling)
* **CI/CD pipelines** (Automated testing and deployment of data pipelines)

These skills will define the data engineering landscape in 2025, emphasizing cloud solutions, real-time processing, and integration with AI/ML technologies.
